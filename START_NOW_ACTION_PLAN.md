## 💬 Questions?

**Common Concerns:**

**"What if we find bugs during testing?"**
→ That's WHY we test early! Week 4 is dedicated to finding and fixing issues.

**"What if developer can't meet Dec 31 deadline?"**
→ We'll assess on Dec 15 (midpoint). If behind, we cut scope or push to Jan 7.

**"What if no one uses it?"**
→ You already get $300 online orders organically. We're making it easier, not creating demand from scratch.

**"What if I get overwhelmed with orders?"**
→ GREAT problem! Add "Max 5 orders per day" limit in system. Raise prices. Hire help.

**"Can I make changes after launch?"**
→ Yes! Webflow is easy to edit. We'll train you. Developer available for bigger changes.

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**You have:**
- ✅ A clear problem (hard to get catering orders)
- ✅ A proven solution (online ordering with instant quotes)
- ✅ The budget ($8,400)

**All that's left:**
