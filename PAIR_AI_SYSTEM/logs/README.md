## Logs

Put exception handling and decisions here.

### Suggested convention

- One markdown file per decision:
  - `YYYY-MM-DD_decision_<short_slug>.md`
- Use `/templates/decision_log_entry_template.md`

### Why this matters

This is where your “institutional memory” lives (without relying on chat history).
