## PAIR Escalation Rules (When to Route + Who Decides)

**Owner**: Chief of Staff Agent  
**Last updated**: 2026-01-12  
**Rule**: Escalate fast. Don’t stall the customer.

---

## 1) Escalation levels

- **Level 1 (COS decides)**: operational/policy decisions that don’t change pricing model or long-term direction
- **Level 2 (Founder decides)**: strategic, financial, brand-risk, legal, or high-revenue exceptions

---

## 2) Always escalate to Chief of Staff

- Price missing from `pricing_rules.md`
- Menu item missing from `menu_catalog.md`
- Customization request outside `customization_rules.md`
- Capacity uncertainty (date/time/guest count feasibility)
- Complaints, refunds, or chargebacks
- VIP / influencer / press requests

---

## 3) Escalate to Founder (via COS) when any is true

- Revenue ≥ $[threshold] (single event)
- Margin exception / discount request outside rules
- Partnership proposals
- Anything involving contracts you don’t already use
- Safety / allergy / liability concerns beyond supported accommodations
- Any request that risks brand reputation

---

## 4) What an escalation must include (required fields)

- **Client**: name + contact
- **Event**: date/time/location
- **Guest count**: [number]
- **Request**: what they asked for (verbatim if possible)
- **Conflict**: which rulebook section is being violated/missing
- **Recommendation**: propose 1–2 options (approve/deny/alternative)
- **Deadline**: when Sales needs an answer

---

## 5) Decision logging

All escalations and decisions must be recorded in `logs/` as a markdown entry:
- What was decided
- Why
- Any rulebook updates required
