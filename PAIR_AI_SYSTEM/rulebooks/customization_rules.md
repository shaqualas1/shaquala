## PAIR Customization Rules (Profit + Consistency Guardrails)

**Owner**: Menu & Pricing Governance Agent  
**Last updated**: 2026-01-12  
**Rule**: Customization is *constrained*. If it breaks margins or ops flow, reject/escalate.

---

## 1) What Sales is allowed to say “yes” to (without escalation)

- **Swap within same category** (pre-approved in `menu_catalog.md`): **Yes**
- **Dietary flags** (supported list in `menu_catalog.md`): **Yes**
- **Add-ons** (listed in `menu_catalog.md` + priced in `pricing_rules.md`): **Yes**
- **Minor styling notes** (e.g., “more fruit”): **Yes, within package scope**

---

## 2) What requires escalation to Chief of Staff

- **Any new menu item** not listed in `menu_catalog.md`
- **Any cooked/hot dish request** (unless explicitly supported)
- **Any pricing exception** (discounts, special bundles, waived fees)
- **Any ingredient sourcing request** that changes cost materially
- **Any promise about exact brands** (unless you stock them reliably)

---

## 3) Hard “no” list (reject politely)

> These are defaults—edit to match your business reality.

- Requests for items on the Prohibited Items list (`menu_catalog.md`)
- “Match competitor pricing”
- “Unlimited/overflow food guarantee”
- Any request that implies unsafe food handling or illegal sales

---

## 4) Custom work rules (if you ever allow it)

- **Custom work is only allowed when**:
  - Lead time ≥ [X] days
  - Minimum invoice ≥ $[amount]
  - Margin target ≥ [X]%
  - Owner approval: [Yes/No]
- **Custom work fee**: $[amount] (or [X]%)  
- **Sampling fee** (optional): $[amount] (credited if booked: [Yes/No])

---

## 5) Messaging templates (Sales-ready)

### Polite decline (out of scope)
“Thanks — we don’t offer that item as part of our current menu. I can recommend one of our listed add-ons or packages that fits your event.”

### Escalation (needs decision)
“That’s a great question — I’m going to confirm internally to make sure we quote it accurately and profitably. I’ll follow up by [time].”
