## 🚀 Phase 2: BYO Charcuterie Bar

### Inspired by Your Staff's Research

**Concept:** NYC's Char-cute-rie model adapted for Pittsburgh

**How It Works:**
1. Customer reserves 30-min timeslot online
2. Arrives at shop (201 Smithfield St)
3. Chooses board size (small $30, medium $50, large $75)
4. Selects from your curated items:
   - 3-5 meats (your staff's list: salami, prosciutto, etc.)
   - 3-5 cheeses (gouda, cheddar, goat cheese, etc.)
   - Fruits, crackers, spreads, garnishes
5. Staff helps arrange on board
6. Takes photos (Instagram moment!)
7. Takes board home or eats in cafe

**Revenue Model:**
- $30-75 per person/group
- 30-min sessions = 10 per day = $300-750/day
- Evenings + weekends = $6,000-15,000/month additional

**Timeline:**
- **Phase 1 (Dec 2025):** Launch catering website
- **Phase 2 (March 2026):** Add BYO Bar once catering is stable
- **Phase 3 (Summer 2026):** Full cafe renovation (cozy seating, warm lighting)

**Website Integration:**
- Add "Build Your Own Board (In-Person)" tab
- Online reservation system
- Show sample boards
- Display available items

---

## 💡 Marketing Strategy Based on Competitors

### **What Competitors Do Well (Copy This):**
- Beautiful Instagram photos (ALL competitors)
- Show boards at real events (social proof)
- Partner with event planners (The Cheese Queen)
- Offer corporate packages (Graze Craze)

### **What Competitors Miss (Your Opportunity):**
- ❌ No instant online ordering
- ❌ No real-time pricing
- ❌ Limited evening hours
- ❌ No BYO experience
- ❌ No themed board packages
- ❌ No downtown presence with ghost kitchen

### **Your Marketing Advantages:**
1. **SEO:** Rank for "Pittsburgh charcuterie catering" (competitors have weak SEO)
2. **Google Ads:** Target "same day catering Pittsburgh" (competitors don't bid on this)
3. **TikTok/Reels:** BYO bar experience is PERFECT for viral content
4. **Corporate Outreach:** Downtown location = easy lunch deliveries
