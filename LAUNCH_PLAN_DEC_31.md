---

### **My Recommendation: Option A (Webflow)**
**Why:**
- ✅ Launches by Dec 31 (meets your deadline)
- ✅ $2,600 cheaper upfront
- ✅ You can edit content yourself (no developer needed for updates)
- ✅ Proven technology (fast, reliable)
- ✅ Can migrate to custom later if needed

**Trade-offs:**
- Less custom features (but you don't need them yet)
- Webflow platform dependency (but you're on WordPress now anyway)

---

## 🎨 Your Catering Pricing Structure (Need Your Input)

I need you to confirm your pricing model. Here are three common approaches:

### **Option 1: Per-Person Pricing** (Recommended)
**Simple, scalable, clients understand it**

- Classic Board: $30/person
- Premium Spread: $45/person
- Deluxe Grazing Table: $65/person

**Example:** 50 guests × $45 = $2,250 + delivery

**Pros:**
- Easy to calculate
- Scales automatically
- Industry standard

---

### **Option 2: Fixed Packages**
**Pre-set sizes, faster checkout**

- Small (10-25 guests): $300
- Medium (25-50 guests): $800
- Large (50-100 guests): $1,500
- XL (100+ guests): Custom quote

**Pros:**
- No thinking required for clients
- Predictable pricing

**Cons:**
- Less flexible

---

### **Option 3: Hybrid** (My Recommendation)
**Fixed packages + custom builder**

- Show packages as starting points
- Allow customization (add meats, cheeses)
- Per-person pricing kicks in for custom

**Example:**
- "Premium Package for 50: Starts at $2,250"
- "+ Add extra prosciutto: $75"
- "+ Gluten-free crackers: $50"

**Pros:**
- Best of both worlds
- Upsell opportunities

---

## 📍 Delivery Pricing Model (Need Your Confirmation)

Based on your constraints:
- Labor: $20/hour
- Gas/mileage: ~$0.50/mile
- Setup time: 15-30 minutes

### **Proposed Pricing:**

| Distance | Fee | Your Cost | Profit |
|----------|-----|-----------|--------|
| 0-5 miles | $25 | ~$15 | $10 |
| 5-10 miles | $25 + $2/mile | ~$20 | $5-10 |
| 10-15 miles | $40 + $3/mile | ~$30 | $10-15 |
| 15+ miles | Custom quote | Varies | Calculate manually |

**Does this work for you?**

If not, we can adjust. Some alternatives:
- Flat $50 delivery (simpler, but might turn away close clients)
- Free delivery over $1,000 (encourages larger orders)
- Tiered: $25 (0-5mi), $45 (5-10mi), $75 (10-15mi)

---

## 📧 Email Address Setup

You'll need a dedicated catering email. Options:

### **Email Setup**
- Primary: info@pairpgh.com (existing)
- Optional: Create catering@pairpgh.com as alias/forward
- All catering inquiries can go to info@pairpgh.com initially
- Can add dedicated catering email later if volume warrants it

**Action:** Confirm info@pairpgh.com is monitored regularly

## 🚨 Potential Roadblocks & Solutions

### **Roadblock 1: "Developer takes longer than expected"**
**Solution:**
- Build in 1-week buffer
- Have backup developer ready

### **Roadblock 2: "Photos aren't good enough"**
**Solution:**
- Stage a mini photo shoot yourself (iPhone okay)
- Hire food photographer for 2 hours ($500)
- Use stock photos temporarily (not ideal but gets you live)

### **Roadblock 3: "You get overwhelmed with catering orders"**
**Solution:**
- Add "Max 5 orders per day" limit in quote system
- Hire part-time help
- Raise prices (good problem!)

### **Roadblock 4: "Staff resistant to new system"**
**Solution:**
- Involve them early (ask for feedback)
- Show how it makes their job easier
- Bonus/incentive for using system

### **Roadblock 5: "Budget overruns"**
**Solution:**
- Get fixed-price quote before starting
- 50% upfront, 50% on completion
