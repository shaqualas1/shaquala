## A Business Owner's Perspective

**From Shaquala, 201 Smithfield Street:**

"I chose Smithfield Street for my coffee and charcuterie shop because I believe in this corridor's potential. As someone who grew up in Pittsburgh and built my career in financial services, I understand both the emotional connection our community has to downtown and the hard numbers that make investment decisions.

Every day, I see customers who love what we're creating but wish there was more. I see the beautiful historic buildings that need attention. I see the foot traffic that could triple with the right improvements. I see adjacent businesses struggling with vacancies when they should be thriving.

**This revitalization isn't just good for business—it's good for Pittsburgh.** It's about creating a place where locals want to gather, where businesses can succeed, and where our city's historic heart beats strong again.

My financial background tells me the ROI is solid. My business owner experience tells me the demand is there. My Pittsburgh roots tell me we can't wait any longer."
